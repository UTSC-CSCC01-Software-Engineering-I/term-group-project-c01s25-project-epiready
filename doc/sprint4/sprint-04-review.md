## Iteration 4 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: August 3rd, 2025
 * Where: Online

#### Decisions that turned out well

* Implementing a comprehensive real-time chat system with both direct and group messaging capabilities has significantly improved team collaboration within organizations. The WebSocket-based architecture ensures instant message delivery and real-time updates.
* The modular chat system design with separate components for sidebar, chat window, and message handling provides excellent user experience and maintainability.
* The chat system's real-time capabilities complement the existing alert system, allowing teams to coordinate responses to temperature and humidity breaches effectively.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

* The chat system still lacks advanced features like file sharing, message reactions, and read receipts that would enhance collaboration for cold-chain logistics teams.
* Real-time weather data integration was not achieved due to API limitations and cost constraints, continuing to rely on mock data for temperature monitoring.
* Mobile notification system for chat messages was not implemented, limiting the system's effectiveness for field operations.
* The chat system doesn't include integration with shipment alerts, missing an opportunity to automatically create discussion threads for critical alerts.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

* Successfully implemented comprehensive real-time chat system with WebSocket integration
* Created both direct messaging and group chat capabilities within organizations
* Added real-time message delivery with instant updates across all connected clients
* Created intuitive chat interface with sidebar navigation and message history
* Established proper authentication and authorization for all chat operations
* Created responsive chat UI that works across different screen sizes
* Implemented chat room creation modal with user selection and group naming

#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

* Real-time weather data integration with OpenWeatherMap API was not achieved due to API key limitations and cost considerations
* Mobile push notifications for chat messages were not implemented
* File sharing capabilities in chat were not developed
* Integration between chat system and alert system for automatic discussion threads was not completed
* Advanced chat features like message reactions, read receipts, and typing indicators were not implemented

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

* The chat system provides a solid foundation for team collaboration and can be extended with additional features like file sharing and advanced messaging capabilities.
* Real-time communication is crucial for cold-chain logistics operations, and the chat system fills an important gap in team coordination.
* The modular architecture of the chat system allows for easy integration with other features like alerts and shipment tracking.
* We need to prioritize real data integration (weather, sensor data) to make the system more valuable for actual operations.
* Future sprints should focus on mobile capabilities, advanced chat features, and deeper integration between different system components to create a more cohesive user experience.
* The organization-based access control system provides a good foundation for scaling the application to multiple organizations and teams.
