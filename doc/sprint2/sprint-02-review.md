## Iteration 2 - Review & Retrospect

 * When: July 6th, 2025
 * Where: Online

#### Decisions that turned out well

* A lot of work was done in parallel, so any issues that arose in the front end that needed to be fixed in the back end could be solved efficiently. 
* Jira tickets were added sequentially and over the course of the entire sprint rather than mostly being added at the end, which allowed us to organize our tasks much more fluidly. 
* We thoroughly tested our app before the Sprint 2 Demo making sure everything works and having multiple people in the team ready to present in case it did not work for one person.

#### Decisions that did not turn out as well as we hoped

* Changing and dropping features and not supplementing them with upgraded ones/Not communicating with founder efficiently to identify further non functional requirements.
* Lack of communication regarding the feature details and testing the features before pushing them.

## Product - Review

#### Goals and/or tasks that were met/completed:

* Able to view individual shipments and their information as it is being updated live.
* Able to track the locations of shipments live using Google Maps. 
* Implementing shipment tracking in maps
* User dashboard for individual shipments


#### Goals and/or tasks that were planned but not met/completed:

* Unable to implement OpenWeatherAPI and actual tracking API, and instead had to use mock data. This was due to the founder only being able to provide mock data. 
* Implementing action history and alert history but there was some error with it so it got postponed to the next sprint.

## Meeting Highlights

Going into the next iteration, our main insights are:

* Going into the next sprint, we are aiming to flesh out our product with more features to make it feel more complete. A general lack of big features is currently a big issue, and so focusing on new larger features such as live push notifications and graphs to show information history will allow us to bring this product to a higher level. 
* Delegating tasks more efficiently among the group will lessen the workload on certain members and ensure more people are putting in their maximum effort, which is why we are putting a lot of focus into thai next sprint.
