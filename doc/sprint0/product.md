# EpiReady
**EpiReady** is an intelligent monitoring and automated response system designed for the cold-chain logistics industry. It detects risks such as temperature excursions, ETA delays, or extreme weather events and triggers automated workflows to mitigate spoilage and product loss. Inspired by research in disease outbreak prediction, EpiReady enables faster, data-driven decisions by consolidating multiple data sources into a single platform and executing timely responses.
